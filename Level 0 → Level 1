Bandit Level 0 → Level 1

Level Goal - The password for the next level is stored in a file called "readme" located in the home directory. Use that password to log in to the next level.



I listed files in the home directory using the "ls" command 

There was a file called readme. I input "cat readme". This showed the password for the next level.



Terminal Output -

bandit0@bandit:~$ ls 
readme

bandit0@bandit:~$ cat readme
