Bandit Level 1 → Level 2

Level Goal: The password for the next level is stored in a file called "-" located in the home directory.



I listed files in the home directory using the ls command.
There was a file named "-". I used "cat ./-" to read the file (prefixing with ./ prevents the - from being treated as an option). 
This displayed the password for the next level.




Terminal Output:

bandit1@bandit:~$ ls
-
bandit1@bandit:~$ cat ./-
[REDACTED PASSWORD OUTPUT]



Entered the SSH command: ssh bandit2@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220

When prompted for the password, I pasted the password. And up to the next level.
