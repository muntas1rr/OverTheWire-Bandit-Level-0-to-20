Bandit Level 2 → Level 3

Level Goal: The password for the next level is stored in a file called --spaces in this filename-- located in the home directory.



I listed files in the home directory using the ls command.

There was a file named --spaces in this filename--. Because the filename begins with dashes and contains spaces, 
I used an explicit path with escaped spaces to prevent the shell from treating the dashes as options: cat ./--spaces\ in\ this\ filename--

This displayed the password for the next level.




Terminal Output:

bandit2@bandit:~$ ls
--spaces in this filename--

bandit2@bandit:~$ cat ./--spaces\ in\ this\ filename--
[The Password for the next level]




Entered the SSH command: ssh bandit3@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220

When prompted for the password, I pasted the password from the file. And up to the next level.
