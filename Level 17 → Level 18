Bandit Level 17 → Level 18

Level Goal:

The password for the next level is in the passwords.new file in the home directory and 
is the only line that has been changed between passwords.old and passwords.new.



I listed files in the home directory using ls and saw passwords.old and passwords.new.
I used the diff passwords.old passwords.new command and found the line that differed. 
I then extracted only the changed line using diff passwords.old passwords.new | grep '>' | sed 's/> //'. 

This gave me the new password for bandit18.



Terminal Output:

bandit17@bandit:~$ ls
passwords.new  passwords.old

bandit17@bandit:~$ diff passwords.old passwords.new
42c42
< [old password - REDACTED]
---
> [new password - REDACTED]

bandit17@bandit:~$ diff passwords.old passwords.new | grep '>' | sed 's/> //'
[[REDACTED PASSWORD OUTPUT]




Entered the SSH command: ssh bandit18@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220

When prompted for the password, I pasted the password. And up to the next level.
