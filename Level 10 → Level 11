Bandit Level 10 → Level 11

Level Goal: 

The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, which contains base64 encoded data.



I listed files in the home directory with ls and saw data.txt.
I viewed the file with cat data.txt and then decoded the base64 using base64 -d data.txt 
to reveal the password for the next level.




Terminal Output:

bandit10@bandit:~$ ls
data.txt

bandit10@bandit:~$ cat data.txt
[REDACTED BASE64 STRING]

bandit10@bandit:~$ base64 -d data.txt
The password is [REDACTED PASSWORD OUTPUT]




Entered the SSH command: ssh bandit11@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220

When prompted for the password, I pasted the password. And up to the next level.
