Bandit Level 8 → Level 9

Level Goal: The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt and is the only line of text that occurs exactly once.



I listed files in the home directory using ls and saw data.txt.
I used sort data.txt | uniq -u to find the only line that occurs once. And the command returned the password for the next level.




Terminal Output:

bandit8@bandit:~$ ls
data.txt

bandit8@bandit:~$ sort data.txt | uniq -u
[REDACTED PASSWORD OUTPUT]




Entered the SSH command: ssh bandit9@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220

When prompted for the password, I pasted the password. And up to the next level.
