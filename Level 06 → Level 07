Bandit Level 6 → Level 7

Level Goal: 

The password for the next level is stored somewhere on the server and 
has all of the following properties: owned by user bandit7, owned by group bandit6, and 33 bytes in size.



I used this find command find / -type f -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c 2>/dev/null to search the filesystem for regular files 
owned by bandit7, group bandit6, and exactly 33 bytes using find. I appended 2>/dev/null, to hide the error messages. 
The command returned /var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password. I displayed that file with cat /var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password, 
which showed the password for the next level.




Terminal Output:

bandit6@bandit:~$ ls

bandit6@bandit:~$ find / -type f -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c 2>/dev/null
/var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password

bandit6@bandit:~$ cat /var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password
[REDACTED PASSWORD OUTPUT]




Entered the SSH command: ssh bandit7@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220

When prompted for the password, I pasted the password. And up to the next level.
