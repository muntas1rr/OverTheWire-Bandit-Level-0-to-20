Bandit Level 3 → Level 4

Level Goal: 

The password for the next level is stored in a hidden file in the inhere directory.



I listed files in the home directory using the ls command and saw the inhere directory. 
I changed into that directory with cd inhere and listed all files, including hidden ones, using ls -la.
There was a hidden file called ...Hiding-From-You. I used cat ./...Hiding-From-You to read the file (explicit path avoids ambiguity). 
This displayed the password for the next level.




Terminal Output:

bandit3@bandit:~$ ls
inhere

bandit3@bandit:~$ cd inhere

bandit3@bandit:~/inhere$ ls -la
total 12
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Oct 14 09:26 .
drwxr-xr-x 3 root root 4096 Oct 14 09:26 ..
-rw-r----- 1 bandit4 bandit3 33 Oct 14 09:26 ...Hiding-From-You

bandit3@bandit:~/inhere$ cat ./...Hiding-From-You
[REDACTED PASSWORD OUTPUT]




Entered the SSH command: ssh bandit4@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220

When prompted for the password, I pasted the password. And up to the next level.
