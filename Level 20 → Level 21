Bandit Level 20 → Level 21

Level Goal:

There is a setuid binary named suconnect in the home directory which connects to localhost on the port you specify. 
It reads a line of text from that connection and compares it to the password from the previous level. 
If the password is correct, it sends back the password for the next level.



I ran two commands in two terminals as bandit20. In one terminal, 
I started a netcat listener on port 9999 and pasted the previous level password. 
In the other terminal, I ran ./suconnect 9999, which connected to the listener, verified the password, 
and sent the next password back to the netcat terminal.




Terminal Output (Terminal 1):

bandit20@bandit:~$ ./suconnect
Usage: ./suconnect <portnumber>
This program will connect to the given port on localhost using TCP. 
If it receives the correct password from the other side, the next password is transmitted back.

bandit20@bandit:~$ ./suconnect 2020
Read: [PREVIOUS LEVEL PASSWORD]
Password matches, sending next password



Terminal Output (Terminal 2):

bandit20@bandit:~$ nc -lvp 2020
Listening on 0.0.0.0 2020
Connection received on localhost 37318
[PREVIOUS LEVEL PASSWORD]
[REDACTED PASSWORD OUTPUT]
