Bandit Level 7 → Level 8

Level Goal: The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt next to the word millionth.



I listed files in the home directory using ls and saw data.txt.
I searched for the word millionth in the file using grep millionth data.txt.
The command returned the line containing millionth followed by the password for the next level.




Terminal Output:

bandit7@bandit:~$ ls
data.txt

bandit7@bandit:~$ grep millionth data.txt
millionth       [The Password for the next level]




Entered the SSH command: ssh bandit8@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220

When prompted for the password, I pasted the password for the next level. And up to the next level.
