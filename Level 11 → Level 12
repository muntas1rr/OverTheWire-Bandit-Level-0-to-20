Bandit Level 11 → Level 12

Level Goal: 

The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, 
where all lowercase (a-z) and uppercase (A-Z) letters have been rotated by 13 positions.



I listed files in the home directory with ls and saw data.txt.
I used the tr command to decode the ROT13 cipher by rotating all letters 13 positions: tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m' < data.txt
The command revealed the password for the next level.




Terminal Output:

bandit11@bandit:~$ ls
data.txt

bandit11@bandit:~$ tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m' < data.txt
The password is [REDACTED PASSWORD OUTPUT]




Entered the SSH command: ssh bandit12@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220

When prompted for the password, I pasted the password. And up to the next level.
