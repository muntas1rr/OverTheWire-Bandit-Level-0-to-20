Bandit Level 9 → Level 10

Level Goal: The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt in one of the few human-readable strings, preceded by several ‘=’ characters.



I listed files in the home directory with ls and saw data.txt.
I used strings data.txt | grep == to extract printable strings that were preceded by '==' and
identify lines beginning with multiple '=' characters.
One of the matching lines contained the password for the next level.




Terminal Output:

bandit9@bandit:~$ ls
data.txt

bandit9@bandit:~$ strings data.txt | grep ==
========== the
========== password
f\Z'========== is
========== [REDACTED PASSWORD OUTPUT]




Entered the SSH command: ssh bandit10@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220

When prompted for the password, I pasted the password. And up to the next level.
