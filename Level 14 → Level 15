Bandit Level 14 → Level 15

Level Goal: 

The password for the next level can be retrieved by 
submitting the password of the current level to port 30000 on localhost.



I read the current level password from /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14 using cat.
I submitted that password to localhost port 30000 using netcat (nc). 
The server responded with "Correct!" and printed the password for the next level.




Terminal Output:

bandit14@bandit:~$ cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14
[PREVIOUS LEVEL PASSWORD]

bandit14@bandit:~$ nc localhost 30000
[PREVIOUS LEVEL PASSWORD]
Correct!
[REDACTED PASSWORD OUTPUT]




Entered the SSH command: ssh bandit15@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220

When prompted for the password, I pasted the password. And up to the next level.
