Bandit Level 15 → Level 16

Level Goal: The password for the next level can be retrieved by 
submitting the password of the current level to port 30001 on localhost using SSL/TLS encryption.



I read the current level password from /etc/bandit_pass/bandit15 using cat.
I opened an SSL/TLS connection to localhost port 30001 using openssl s_client and submitted the password.
The server responded with "Correct!" and printed the password for the next level.




Terminal Output:

bandit15@bandit:~$ openssl s_client -connect localhost:30001
CONNECTED(00000003)
...
(SSL/TLS handshake details; self-signed certificate warning)
...
[PREVIOUS LEVEL PASSWORD]
Correct!
[REDACTED PASSWORD OUTPUT]




Entered the SSH command: ssh bandit16@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220

When prompted for the password, I pasted the password. And up to the next level.
