Bandit Level 4 → Level 5

Level Goal: The password for the next level is stored in the only human-readable file in the inhere directory.



I listed files in the home directory using the ls command and saw the inhere directory. 
I changed into that directory with cd inhere and listed the files using ls. There were multiple files named like -file00 through -file09. 
To find which one was human-readable, I ran file ./* to check each file's type. 
The output showed that -file07 was ASCII text. I read it with cat ./-file07 which displayed the password for the next level.




Terminal Output:

bandit4@bandit:~$ ls
inhere

bandit4@bandit:~$ cd inhere

bandit4@bandit:~/inhere$ ls
-file00 -file02 -file04 -file06 -file08
-file01 -file03 -file05 -file07 -file09

bandit4@bandit:~/inhere$ file ./*

[The Password for the next level]




Entered the SSH command: ssh bandit5@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220

When prompted for the password, I pasted the password for the next level. And up to the next level.
