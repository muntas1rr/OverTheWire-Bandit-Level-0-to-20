Bandit Level 13 → Level 14

Level Goal: 

The password for the next level is stored in /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14 and
can only be read by user bandit14. For this level you are given a private SSH key (sshkey.private)
that can be used to log into the next level.



I listed files in my bandit13 home directory with ls and saw sshkey.private.
I displayed the private key with cat sshkey.private to copy it to my local machine.
I logged out of the bandit13 shell, saved the key locally into a file named key,
set secure permissions, and used it to get to the next level.
