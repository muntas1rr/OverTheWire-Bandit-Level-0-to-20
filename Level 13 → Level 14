Bandit Level 13 → Level 14

Level Goal: The password for the next level is stored in /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14 and can only be read by user bandit14. 
For this level you are given a private SSH key (sshkey.private) which must be used from your local machine to log into 
[bandit14@bandit.labs.overthewire.org](mailto:bandit14@bandit.labs.overthewire.org) on port 2220.



I listed files in my bandit13 home directory with ls and saw sshkey.private.
I displayed the private key with cat sshkey.private to copy it to my local machine (do not share this key publicly).
I logged out of the bandit13 shell, saved the key locally into a file named key, set secure permissions, and used it to get to the next level.
