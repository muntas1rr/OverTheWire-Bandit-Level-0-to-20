Bandit Level 18 → Level 19

Level Goal:

The next level’s password is in the readme file in the home directory, 
but logging in normally logs you out instantly due to .bashrc modifications.



I tried logging in normally with SSH, but was immediately logged out. So, 
I used SSH with the -t /bin/sh option to start a shell and avoid automatic logout. 

After logging in, I read the readme file to find the password for the next level.




Terminal Output:

ubuntu:~$ ssh bandit18@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
(password prompt) [I INPUT THE PASSWORD]
Byebye! (logged out immediately)

ubuntu:~$ ssh -p 2220 bandit18@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -t /bin/sh
# (password prompt) [I SUCCESSFULLY LOGGED IN AFTER INPUTTING THE PASSWORD]

$ ls
readme

$ cat readme
[REDACTED PASSWORD OUTPUT]



Entered the SSH command: ssh bandit19@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220

When prompted for the password, I pasted the password. And up to the next level.
