Bandit Level 16 → Level 17

Level Goal: The password for the next level is obtained by sending the current level password to 
an SSL service running on one of the ports in the range 31000–32000. 
The service returns a private SSH key when the correct password is submitted.



I scanned localhost ports 31000–32000 with nmap -sV to find open/SSL services. 
I identified an SSL service on port 31790, sent the current password to that port
using openssl s_client -connect localhost:31790 -quiet, and the service responded with
“Correct!” followed by a private RSA key. I saved the returned key locally as bandit17.key,
set secure permissions, and used it to SSH into bandit17 on the remote server.




Terminal Output (remote):

bandit16@bandit:~$ nmap -sV localhost -p 31000-32000
(…nmap output showing open ports…)
31790/tcp open  ssl/unknown
(…)

bandit16@bandit:~$ echo "[PREVIOUS LEVEL PASSWORD]" | openssl s_client -connect localhost:31790 -quiet
